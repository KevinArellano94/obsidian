Data residency requirements refer to the geographical location where data must be stored and processed. National sovereignty, data privacy, and national security concerns often drive these regulations.

## Implications

- Certain geographic locations might **require data to reside in certain locations**. For example, the **European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** imposes strict data residency requirements stipulating that personal data of EU citizens must be stored and processed within the EU unless specific conditions are met.
- **Certain jurisdictions have specific laws and regulations** regarding the **storage** and **processing** of certain types of data, such as **PII** and **PHI**. 
- **Failure to comply** with data residency requirements can lead to **legal issues**, such as **data localization requirements** or **cross-border data transfer restrictions**.

## Compliance requirements

- **Ensure** that the **storage** and **processing** of data, including any PII or PHI, **complies** with the **relevant data residency regulations**.
- **Implement appropriate measures** to address data residency requirements, such as using **cloud services** or **data centers located in specific regions** or **countries**.
