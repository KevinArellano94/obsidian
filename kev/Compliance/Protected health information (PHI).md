Protected health information is a specific **subset of PII** that relates to an **individual's physical or mental health**, **health care**, or **payment for health care**. PHI can include **medical records**, **test results**, **diagnoses**, and **billing information**.

## Implications

- The use of PHI in machine learning is heavily **regulated by laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** in the United States and similar legislation in other countries.
- **Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure** of PHI can result in **significant fines** and **legal consequences**.
- Appropriate handling of PHI is essential in order to maintain the trust and privacy of individuals receiving healthcare services.

## Compliance requirements

- Obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting, using, or sharing their PHI. **Individual consent alone to use data does not satisfy compliance requirements**, so be sure to take additional security measures.
- Implement robust data security measures, including **access controls**, **redaction**, **masking**, **audit trails**, and **secure data storage** and **transmission**. 
- **Appoint a designated privacy officer to oversee the management** of PHI and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. 
- Provide **comprehensive training to employees on the proper handling** of PHI.
