## Did you know?

If you have a burning desire to know the origins of _caustic_, you're already well on your way to figuring it out. _Caustic_ was formed in Middle English as an adjective describing chemical substances, such as [lime](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lime#h1) and [lye](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lye), that are capable of destroying or eating away at something. The word is based on the Latin adjective _causticus_, which itself comes ultimately from the Greek verb _kaiein_, meaning "to burn." In time, _caustic_ was baked into the English language as an adjective describing people or things (such as wit or remarks) that are bitingly sarcastic. Other _kaiein_ descendants in English include _[cautery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cautery)_ and _[cauterize](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cauterize)_, _[causalgia](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/causalgia)_ (a burning pain caused by nerve damage), and _[encaustic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/encaustic)_ (a kind of paint that is heated after it's applied).
