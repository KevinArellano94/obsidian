## Overview

Senior Manager, Solutions Architecture (Data Security Pre-sales)- Remote

Ever since our first credit card customer in 1994, Capital One has recognized that technology and data can enable even large companies to be innovative and personalized. As one of the first large enterprises to go all-in on the public cloud, Capital One needed to build cloud and data management tools that didn’t exist in the marketplace to enable us to operate at scale in the cloud. And in 2022, we publicly announced Capital One Software and brought our first B2B software solution, Slingshot, to market.

Building on Capital One’s pioneering adoption of modern cloud and data capabilities, Capital One Software is helping accelerate the data management journey at scale for businesses operating in the cloud. If you think of the kind of challenges that companies face – things like data publishing, data consumption, data governance, and infrastructure management – we’ve built tools to address these various needs along the way. Capital One Software will continue to explore where we can bring our solutions to market to help other businesses address these same needs going forward.

We are seeking top tier talent to join our pioneering team and propel us towards our destination. You will be joining a team of innovative product, tech, and design leaders that tirelessly seek to question the status quo.
