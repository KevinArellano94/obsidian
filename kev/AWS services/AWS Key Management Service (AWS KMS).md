You can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys for data encryption. These keys can be used to encrypt data stored in a variety of AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Redshift, and more.

With AWS KMS, there are two main types of keys:Â 
- **Customer managed keys**: The customer has full control of the creation, rotation, and deletion of encryption keys.  
- **AWS managed keys**: AWS provisions and maintains the keys, which simplifies the key management process for the customer.
