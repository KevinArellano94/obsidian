The data sources that the Lambda functions interact with, such as databases, file storage, or other data stores, might contain sensitive information. You can **enable data at rest encryption for the relevant data sources**. Enabling this encryption allows the Lambda functions to access and process the encrypted data without exposing the sensitive information.
